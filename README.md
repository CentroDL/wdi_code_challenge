**Email Prediction**

This is a proposed solution to the following code challenge presented here:

https://gist.github.com/h4w5/a4a3747c0368fcdec044


**Prerequisites:**

Ruby, and RSpec

gem install rspec

*To Run Tests*

In Terminal:

$rspec

**The Approach**

I approached this problem by writing a Prediction class with an email method that takes in a user's first name, last name, and company domain, and generates a possible email. Tests were written with rspec to match possible emails to patterns established in pre existing data.
